    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
    <p>One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colors—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.</p>
    <p>Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) and uses onions and olives. The Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, adding anchovies to olives and onions. Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
