    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.</p>
    <p>Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural. The name is believed to come from a Latin word for cooking pot, lasanum, though some etymologies trace it to the Greek flatbread called laganon, known in Italy since at least the time of Augustus Caesar (63 bce−14 ce). Lasagna in its modern form, made of a meat sauce much like ragù Bolognese that is layered with noodles and béchamel (besciamella or balsamella) sauce, is believed to have originated in the province of Emilia-Romagna. Variations abound throughout Italy: the lasagna served in Naples, for example, usually contains small meatballs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sliced hard-boiled eggs, while that served in Genoa uses pesto as its sauce. Some recipes use sausage as well as other types of ground meat; others incorporate mushrooms into the ragù.</p>
    <p>American lasagna—the southern term is generally used, since most Italian Americans trace their origins to southern Italy—tends to follow the Neapolitan template, but with many variations. A vegetarian version, for example, will replace meat with spinach and sometimes other vegetables such as peppers and squash. Noodles known in Italy as lasagne verdi are made with spinach as an ingredient.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>  
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>  
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>  
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>  
        <li>½ cup water</li>  
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>  
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li> 
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li> 
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li> 
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li> 
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>  
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
